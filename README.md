# Systematic survey of cytochrome P450s in gut bacteria
GitHub repository to support the development of the project "Systematic survey of cytochrome P450s in gut bacteria".

# Introduction
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) are known for being capable of doing hydroxylation of inactivated C–H bonds. Eukaryotic CYPs are
intensively studied due to their role in drug metabolism. Prokaryotic CYPs, although less studied, they perform a wider range of chemical
reactions. Prokaryotic CYPs have been identified in the cell’s cytosol doing oxidations and hydroxylations of compounds. However, the role
of the CYPs in the gut microbiota is still uncertain. In this project, we selected 10 relevant bacteria from the human gut encoding CYPs to study how CYPs affect their interactions in an in silico modeled community. We found that by using the SteadyCom to observe the abundance of the
species, not all of the species can grow in the medium obtained by using Evolutionary Algorithm. This could have happened because the medium
needed more iterations or there are too many species in the community. With this results we could not find conclusive answers about the role of CYPs in bacteria.
